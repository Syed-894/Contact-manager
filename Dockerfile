# Step 1: Use an official Node.js image to build the app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use a lightweight web server to serve the app
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the built files to the Nginx directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
